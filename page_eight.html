  <h1>My Statement</h1>
  <h3>"This is my first semester at San Jose State University, it is also my first time making art in Art 74. Most of the arts I created in this class are connected mostly to the internet, as well as social media. Since social media affected us a lot in our daily life nowadays, so I got inspired a lot from my own experiences on social media. Furthermore, in this class, it required to use a lot of apps including Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Premiere Pro, Audacity, Atom, and Github to create our works. It is important for me to understand the function of each of the apps clearly, so I could use it right on the project which needed that function. Besides that, knowing the short cut of each of the apps could save me a lot of time. There is one rule that I believe it could save us most of the time is to remember to click “Ctrl+S” on every change as you go, or otherwise, you will have to redo everything if your computer crashes.

I spend most of my time doing outside research to collect sources that I can use on my works. For instance, the Audio/Video Art, it required to record a 1 minute long of three different sounds including texture, space, and signals then combine it with the video. To record the audio, I have to use my phone to record all the sounds that I need, then I transfer it to my tablet. Imported all three sounds to the Audacity then add the effects on the part where I wanted it to be. Save it, then exported the sound to the document. Next, import all of the clips that I will use it for this project into Adobe Premiere Pro. Select the part that I want from each of the clips then pull it down to the screen on the bottom, then add in video transition, or video effects. Save it. Exported the video down to the class document. Lastly, create an account on Vimeo then published it on the website."</h3>
